# Grapefruit Timer

This project is a spin on the popular "Pomodoro Technique", which incorporates a block of working time followed by shorter break - typically 25 min on, 5 min off. This technique has been proven to increase productivity when working on longer tasks, such as programming. I have found this tool very useful while learning to program and therefore found it fitting to create my own version of this famous timer!

The method was originally developed by an Italian man named Francesco Cirillo. The word "pomodoro" translating to "tomato" in enlgish, was used as the name because Francesco was inspired by his tomato-shaped kitchen timer. You can read more on the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique. A grapefruit was chosen for this spin-off project because the translation to Italian, "pompelmo" sounds somewhat similar to "pomodoro".
